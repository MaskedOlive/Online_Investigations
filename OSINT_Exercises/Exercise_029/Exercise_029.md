# OSINT Exercise 029

## Task Brief & Goals
From intelligence given, the photograph was taken on a train ride in the United Kingdom. The photographer always prefers a quiet area where no one can sit behind them, as in a public space, no information is truly private.

The task is to find the following:
1. What the person in front is reading. 
2. Identify the model of train that the photographer is on.
3. Identify the seat number that the photographer is sat at the particular time.

## Initial Thoughts

1. Image will need to be reversed in order to be able to see the words written on the book
2. Train carriage has a locker storage rack overhead
3. Theme of the train is Grey / Red


## Solution

Since the image needs to be reversed this is our first task, using a software such as [PineTools](https://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwiy5_qF4s2OAxUqVEEAHTvTF68QFnoECBcQAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fpinetools.com%2Fflip-image&usg=AOvVaw2DaC8YLYyvn0OobxPhscO_&opi=89978449)
